                  <p>If you want to make money online, then the very best way to do that is to sell a product.<br />
          </p>
                  <p> And if you want to sell as many products as possible, then you need to use a sales funnel.</p>
                  <p>A sales funnel is a tried and tested method for capturing the maximum number of visitors and getting them to buy from you. This is all about building a relationship, building interest and building trust. </p>
                  <p>When you do this correctly, you will gradually warm your visitors up to the point where they&rsquo;re ready and excited to buy from you and that can make a <em>huge </em>difference to your conversions and your profits.</p>
                 <p class="subhead" align="center"><br />
  <strong>Why Isn't Everyone Implementing a Sales Funnel?</strong></p>
                  <p>The problem is that 90% of internet marketers aren&rsquo;t doing this correctly right now.<br />
                    </p>
                  <p>The best explain why a sales funnel is important, let&rsquo;s imagine a scenario for a moment. Imagine that someone approached you in the street with the offer to buy a watch for $5,000. There&rsquo;s a 99.99% chance you would just turn them down. </p>
                  <p>Why? </p>
                  <p>Because you don&rsquo;t know anything about them. You&rsquo;re not ready to spend that kind of money. You&rsquo;re probably not in a position to buy a watch… the list goes on.</p>
                  <p>When you&rsquo;re an internet marketer with a website that is all about selling, selling, selling, that&rsquo;s <em>exactly </em>how you come across. Your audience doesn&rsquo;t know you, they&rsquo;re not targeted and they&rsquo;re not ready to buy.</p>
                  <p>A sales funnel though means that you&rsquo;re going to focus not on selling but instead on getting their details, then gradually increasing their engagement and selling them increasingly expensive items. </p>
                  <p>They&rsquo;ll gradually trust you more and become more interested in buying <em>more </em>things from you.<br />
                    </p>
                  <p>Then, when you try and sell them that $2,000 course, you&rsquo;ll actually have a chance of success.<br />
                    </p>
                  <p>This is something that the sales industry has known for decades. This is the way you sell big ticket items and it&rsquo;s how you see <em>massive </em>increases in your revenue.<br />
</p>
                  <p class="subhead" align="center"><br />
  <strong>What's The Solution?</strong></p> 
                  <p>You could study many hours, days even weeks on how to best implement a sales funnel or you could learn and model from those who have done it already. </p>
                  <p>That's why I wrote a guide on sales funnels.</p>
